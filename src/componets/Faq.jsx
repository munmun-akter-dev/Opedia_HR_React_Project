                          designed to streamline HR processes within organizations. While PEOs
                          also offer HR services, they typically handle tasks like payroll,
                          benefits administration, and compliance on behalf of client companies,
                          acting as co-employers for their employees. OPediaHR focuses more on
                          internal HR management rather than outsourcing HR functions to a third
                          party like a PEO.
